# Project Three: Image Classification with ConvNets

The project here is design to teach you the basics of deep neural networks.  
You will design a ConvNet (also call a CNN or Convolution Neural Network) to ingest images and  
classify the dominant object in the image. The objective here is to get accustomed to programming  
with PyTorch (or Keras), and learn the workflow for training neural networks. In addition to training  
from scratch, to will also learn to load pretrained models that are then finetuned on your dataset (transfer learning).  


We will work through a series of steps:
1. Acquire, Load, and Explore the Data
2. Prepare the Data for your ConvNet
3. Select and Prepare your ConvNet Model
4. Utilize transfer learning, finetuning, and training from scratch.
5. Evaluate and reiterate to improve your ConvNet.

Similar to the previous projects, we will consolidate this notebook into four following task:

* Task 1 is dedicated to EDA on the image dataset.
* Task 2 prepares the data into the correct format and instantiates your ConvNet (+ with pretrained weights if doing EC).
* Task 3 is building an accurate ConvNet. Train your own model. You can use an off-the-self model with finetuning as 20% EC.
* Task 4 completes the testing, and analysis. Is the model accurate on the testset? How can it be improved? Show what changes you did to improve (batch size, learning rate, etc).

For this project, the data is provided in a zip file attached into the Canvas page.
